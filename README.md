# Satania: The best Waifu. Ever.

[Click here to see the website live!](http://satania.moe/)

So... this is the github page of my amazing satania website.

Tho, since the website is just a huge shitpost, it was kinda rushed... Particulary the mobile version...

Don't look at the code too much...

## Building

Download the dependencies by running `npm install` at the root of the project

Then type `gulp build` to build

And `gulp serve` to run a nice webserver that automagically rebuilds the website when you change something

Write your code in `src/` and it gets build in `dist/`, tho the files never gets removed, but it's safe to completly delete `dist/`, so do that often

...

That's it, lol

## License

This ~~Shitpost~~ project is released under the SDL 1.0 License (the Satania Daiakuma License), which is basically like MIT, except you can't use this project to promote any other characters except Satania, more infos are in the `LICENSE.md` file.

Yeah, I really thought of everything...
